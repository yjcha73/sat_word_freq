Questions 1-10 are based on the following
passage.

This passage is adapted from Nina Revoyr, The Age of
Dreaming. ©2008 by Nina Revoyr. The narrator describes
acting in silent films in the early 1900s. Moran owns the
production company that employs the narrator.

It is amusing, in retrospect, to think how
primitive our efforts were in those early years. For
my first two films, all of the interiors were shot on
Line outdoor sets, with canvases draped over them to

5 soften the sun. All copies of Jamestown Junction have
long been lost, but if the film had survived, and if you
could see it, you would notice that during the office
scene the papers on my desk are disturbed by a
mysterious breeze. And in the very next scene, you
10 would see a shadow moving in the corner, caused by
the canvas flapping in the wind. These were the
conditions in which we shot at that time, and because
we worked without the benefit of artificial light, there
was always a rush to complete the day’s filming

15 before the shadows grew too deep in the afternoon.

In late May, when we endured an unexpected heat

wave, Moran had giant ice blocks delivered to the

sets, and powerful fans placed behind them to blow
the cool air in the direction or the players. If it rained,
20 filming would halt altogether, and we would
scramble to move all the furniture and props under
the complex’s few permanent roofs. But despite these
challenges, everyone remained in good spirits.

We were working, yes, but it felt like play, and it was
25 hard to comprehend the tremendous good fortune

that had suddenly befallen me.

Through the making of both films, Hanako gave
me constant guidance, which I eagerly accepted.
And I immediately discerned the difference between

30 myself, an untrained amateur, and a seasoned
professional who knew everything about the art of
acting. Indeed, she was perhaps the largest influence
on my development as an actor.

“There is no audience to see you,” she said one

35 day in Japanese, as I gestured expansively to convey
my anguish at the death of one of my fellow soldiers.
“You don’t need to project like you would in the
theater, as if you're trying to be seen by the person in
the last row. Pretend the camera is the one man

40 you're playing to.”

On another occasion when I was perhaps too
understated, Hanako approached me after Moran
called “cut.” “You're painting a picture with your
body,” she said. “Think of pantomime. You must

45 express physically what you can’t with your voice.
And use your face, your eyes. You have such eyes.
They alone speak volumes.”

Moran nodded in agreement, although he
couldn’t have understood, and I adjusted my actions

50 accordingly. I was surprised by the extent to which
he let Hanako direct things—not only my own
performance, but also the placement of props, even
the movements of the other actors. Yet all of her
suggestions improved the films. And between her

55 advice and Moran’s direction, I was slowly learning
what to do. The transition from theater, which
depends on dialogue, was more difficult than I had
imagined—indeed, many stage actors, even those
who didn’t disdain the new medium or moving

[CONTINUE 4
60 pictures, did not make the change successfully.
Hanako Minatoya was one of the few who was
equally accomplished in both realms. I was learning
under her tutelage every day.

On certain days, when we weren't in scenes,

65 Hanako and I would leave the sets and walk into the
hills. They were vibrant with color, with flowers
wherever one looked—blue brodiaea and lupin,

Mariposa lilacs, the wispy orange California poppies.

The beauty of that landscape, when the air was cool,

70 the sun glinting off the ocean, and the breeze
carrying the scent of the flowers, was so dramatic I
could hardly believe it real. And I was seeing it,
feeling it, in the company of an artist whose work I
had admired for years.

75 One day on our walk we were discussing a
well-known actor, and Hanako surprised me by her
reaction to his name. “He is nothing but a face for
the fan magazines,” she said dismissively. “He is not
a genuine actor.”

80. “What do you mean?” I asked, although I didn’t
disagree.

“It is impossible to distinguish one of his roles
from another. He is always the same, and it is
obvious why. In order to project a believable fiction,

85 the actor himself must have substance. You must

possess something internally to perform it externally.

He has only a fraction of the talent of an artist such
as you.”
I was, of course, deeply flattered by her
90 compliment, and I did not know how to respond.
Hanako continued talking of this actor and that,
without noting my reaction.

Questions 11-20 are based on the following
passage and supplementary material.

This passage is adapted from Giorgia Guglielmi, “Small
News Outlets Influence Us More Than We Think.” ©2017 by
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Assessing the influence of news media is tricky.
Researchers can’t peer into voting booths or people’s
living rooms, and news organizations aren’t typically

Line willing to have outsiders interfere with their content.
5 That’s why it took a team of social scientists 5 years
to get 48 U.S. news organizations to agree to run an
unusual set of experiments. Instead of simply
tracking what the outlets were publishing and
analyzing their impact on public opinion, the
10 researchers took an approach similar to that used in
clinical trials to evaluate the effects of new drugs.
They manipulated the type of news stories run, and
then assigned a “treatment” week when the stories
would run and a “control” week when they wouldn't.
15 This way they could tell whether those particular
stories were having any effect on public discussion.
Most participating outlets were small, with fewer
than an estimated 200,000 pageviews per month, and
a few were midsized, like the Wisconsin-based
magazine The Progressive, which had more than
250,000 pageviews per month. The nonprofit news
organization Truthout, based in Chicago, Illinois,
represented a large outlet, with an estimated
2 million pageviews per month.
25 The researchers, led by Gary King of Harvard
University, asked groups of two to five of these news
outlets to write stories on broad policy areas,
including race, immigration, and climate. For
example, if the broad area was technology policy, the
specific story might be what Uber drivers think about
self-driving cars. The outlets could choose the policy
area, the stories to cover, and the type of articles to
write, such as investigative reports or opinion pieces.
However, the researchers could reject a story if it was
35 outside a specific policy area. (The outlets were free
to publish whatever story they wanted outside of the
experiment.)
Then, the researchers flipped a coin to decide
during which of two consecutive weeks these clusters
40 of stories, all on the same topic, would run. Finally,
they measured the number of tweets about both the
specific stories and the broader policy issues during
the week when the stories ran compared to the week
when they didn’t.

45 ‘Twitter posts on these topics increased by nearly
63% over the week in which the stories were posted.
On average, Americans wrote more than
13,000 additional social media posts about a specific
policy area on the day the stories ran and in the

50 following 5 days. What’s more, the cluster of stories
swayed people’s opinion by 2.3% in the ideological
direction of opinion articles, suggesting that news
media might in some cases change people’s beliefs.

The team repeated the experiment 35 times, and

55 observed that stories boosted posting by men and
women alike, as well as by people living in different
USS. regions, with different political orientations and
influence on Twitter. Removing larger outlets from
the analysis didn’t change the effect on public

60 conversation much, suggesting that no single large
news organization was responsible for the increase.

However, if the researchers had recruited large
mainstream outlets, the spike in discussion might
have been much bigger: When they looked at stories

65 published by The New York Times on little-discussed
topics, such as how fracking affects the quality of
drinking water, they found that Twitter posts about
the broader issue of water quality increased by 300%
in just 1 day.

70 ‘Though excited by the study, economist Matthew
Gentzkow points out that only about 20% of
Americans use Twitter, so the results might not be
widely applicable outside social media. But to King,
Twitter users are a valuable resource to assess the

75 agenda-setting power of media because they
represent those people who are willing to speak up to
influence policy.

Questions 21-31 are based on the following
passage and supplementary material.

This passage is adapted from Clint Perry and Olli Loukola,
“We Taught Bees to Play Football So We Could Learn about
Their Brains.” ©2017 by The Conversation US, Inc.

Most people don’t often think about bees’
brainpower. Bees are generally regarded as tiny
unthinking machines, flying from flower to flower,
Line genetically pre-programmed to collect pollen and

5 nectar and make honey.

But bees have some impressive cognitive
capacities. Bumblebees and honeybees can count,
navigate complex environments, learn concepts, use
their uncertainty to guide their decisions, and even

10 display emotion-like behaviour.

Recently, bees have also been trained to solve
complex cognitive tasks such as string pulling and
cap pushing to gain rewards. But as impressive as
these tasks might be, they resemble some of the bees’

15 natural foraging behaviour. Our research group
wanted to test the behavioural limits of bumblebees
by tasking them with something far removed from
anything they encounter in nature.

So we've managed to show that bees can play

20 football. Sort of. We showed that they can learn to
move a small ball to a goal to gain a sugary reward.

To do this, we used a plastic model bee on the end
of a transparent stick to move a tiny ball across a
platform as a real bumblebee watched. When the ball

25 reached a specified location at the centre of the
platform, it opened access to rewarding sugar water.
After several observations, each real bee we tested
picked up how to solve the task and no longer
needed demonstrations.

30 While mastering this unnatural task was
impressive, we were curious to know how the bees
were actually learning to solve it. So we tested three
further groups of bees. One group of bees watched
another previously trained bee move the ball to the

35 centre. A second group of bees observed the ball
moving to the centre “by itself” (we actually used a
magnet under the platform to move the ball). Anda
third group of bees did not receive any
demonstration.

40 ‘The movement of the ball with the magnet was
enough for some of the bees to learn the task
significantly better than the bees who did not receive
any demonstration. But all ten bees observing
another bee move the ball to the centre solved the

45 task much quicker and at a higher success rate than
either of the other groups. This suggests the observer
bees picked up something important from their
fellow bees that helped them learn this unnatural
task.

50 The design of this experiment also allowed us to
ask a novel question in social learning experiments:
when learning from others, will bees simply copy
what they see or can they improve upon it? During
each of the observation trials, there were three balls

55 positioned at varying distances from the centre of the
platform, but it was always the furthest ball that was
moved during the demonstration. But during the test
trials, on their own, the observer bees almost always
moved the closest ball to the centre. This suggests

60 bees weren't simply copying what they saw during
the demonstration but actually improved on the task
by using the easiest means.

Our current findings suggest with convincing
evidence that a miniature brain is not necessarily

65 simple, and can solve an impressively complex task.
In fact, we are not yet aware of a cognitive ability that
is specific to large brains. What’s more, neurobiology
and modelling research suggests that a very
limited number of neurons (even just a few) can

70 accomplish some rather complex cognitive tasks.

We have shown that bumblebees can solve a task
they’ve unlikely ever seen in their evolutionary
history. No flower has likely ever required bees to
move an object into its centre to gain access to

75 nectar. The fact that bees learned this unnatural and
complex task through observation alone and could
improve on what they saw, rather than simply copy
what they observed, shows an unprecedented
amount of cognitive flexibility in an animal with

80 such a small brain.

Questions 32-42 are based on the following
passage.

This passage is adapted from a speech delivered in 1841 by
Thomas Paul to the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, “Let
Us Do Justice to an Unfortunate People.” Paul, a black
abolitionist, worked with white abolitionist leader William
Lloyd Garrison, who founded the American Anti-Slavery
Society in 1833.

I have often asked myself, what posterity would
think of the strange contest in which the abolitionists
are engaged. Here we meet, time after time,

Line newspapers are printed and speeches delivered, to

5 prove—what? Why, that a man is a man, and that he
is the only human possessor of himself. But these
propositions are self-evident propositions, and
self-evident propositions we all know, though the
most difficult to be proved, are the most easily

10 understood, because they need no proof. The mind
sees their truth intuitively, without the aid of
reasoning. The attempt to prove them, therefore,
would be ridiculous, were it not for the consideration
of the amazing state of delusion and vassalage to

15 which prejudice reduces the mind when
unenlightened by reason.

The history of every age shows the truth of this
assertion. At one time, we see Galileo thrown into
prison by the Inquisition, because he had made some

20 discoveries ... and forced to purchase his liberty by
retracting his opinions. ... When, therefore, we see
the control which prejudice, aided by circumstances
and encouraged by self, interest, has in times past
exercised over the human mind, and the tenacity

25 with which it has held its deluded victims, stopping
up the avenues of improvement, clipping the wings
of genius, and retarding the progress of truth—when
we see the minds whose energies have been crippled,
and whose spheres of action have been curtailed by

30 its influence—when we see the tremendous power
which reformers have brought to bear against the
prevailing sins of the ages in which they lived, the
firm opposition they encountered, and the long and
arduous struggles which preceded a better state of

35 things—we are led, by analogical reasoning, to
believe, that the contest in which we are engaged is
not an unnatural one—that it is not so dissimilar in
its character and measures to others which have been
carried triumphantly through—that the modern

40 champions of freedom do not savor so much of
quixotism [impracticality] as their traducers have

represented—and that the unfortunate men, whose
cause they have espoused, have as just a claim to
humanity as their oppressors, and like them have

45 been created a little lower than the angels. ...

How was it five years ago in regard to the question
of slavery! A gloom hung over the moral atmosphere,
which nothing seemingly could dissipate, save a
miracle from God himself. All saw it, but no one

so durst expose his own breast to the pitiless peltings of
the gathering storm. The pulpit and the press, instead
of being faithful to their trust, were the panders to
the general lust. But mind, like matter, must have its
legitimate scope. ... There are always some spirits

55 who will resist such unnatural domination. And such
a spirit was found in the father of American
anti-slavery. In that dark hour, he arose to cheer us
on our gloomy pathway. The shafts of criticism, and
sarcasm, and denunciation, which rang against his

60 buckler [shield], told only where he stood up
unscathed, in his moral and intellectual might, and
bearing down all opposition. The result is well
known, nor does Mr. Garrison need any eulogy from
me.

65 ‘The task of a reformer is far from being an
agreeable one. The hidden springs which are to be
touched by him, and set into motion, are not
discernible to common eyes; and, if they were, few
would know how to approach or dare to meddle with

70 them. He scatters his truths among the body politic,
and the effect is electrical. He is greeted at once with
smiles and frowns, with blessing and cursing, with
eulogy and abuse. Now he is almost stifled with the
caresses of devoted friends, and anon he is exposed

75 to the fury of a blood-thirsty mob. But, if it is
melancholy to see some run mad, we have the
gratification to behold others restored to their
reason. Much may depend upon accidental
circumstances for the success of the reformer, but

80 more depends upon himself. In him are found the
great qualities of the head and heart. For the burden
of proof is upon him, and he is to answer cavils
[petty objections], refute sophistry [falsehood], and
prove his propositions, while slanderers are

85 crucifying his reputation, and assassins are aiming
deadly daggers at his heart. All moral reformations
have been attended with more or less persecution;
but the American abolitionists stand preeminently
distinguished in this respect.

Questions 43-52 are based on the following
passages.

Passage 1 is adapted from “Free-Floating Planets May Be
More Common Than Stars.” Published in 2011 by National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Passage 2 is adapted
from Ashley Yeager, “Fewer Big Rogue Planets Roam the
Galaxy, Recount Shows.” ©2017 by Society for Science & the
Public.

Passage 1
A survey scanned toward the center of the Milky
Way galaxy during 2006 and 2007, revealing
evidence for up to 10 free-floating planets roughly
Line the mass of Jupiter. The isolated orbs, also known as
5 orphan planets, are difficult to spot, and had gone
undetected until now. The planets are located at an
average approximate distance of 10,000 to
20,000 light years from Earth.
This could be just the tip of the iceberg. The team

10 estimates there are about twice as many free-floating
Jupiter-mass planets as stars. In addition, these
worlds are thought to be at least as common as
planets that orbit stars. This adds up to hundreds of
billions of lone planets in our Milky Way galaxy

15 alone.

“Our survey is like a population census,” said
David Bennett, a coauthor of the 2011 study. “We
sampled a portion of the galaxy, and based on these
data, can estimate overall numbers in the galaxy.”

20. +The survey is not sensitive to planets smaller than
[with lower mass than] Jupiter and Saturn, but
theories suggest lower-mass planets like Earth should
be ejected from their stars more often. As a result,
they are thought to be more common than

25 free-floating Jupiters.

Previous observations spotted a handful of
free-floating planet-like objects within star-forming
clusters, with masses three times that of Jupiter. But
scientists suspect the gaseous bodies form more like
stars than planets. These small, dim orbs, called
brown dwarfs, grow from collapsing balls of gas and
dust, but lack the mass to ignite their nuclear fuel
and shine with starlight. It is thought the smallest
brown dwarfs are approximately the size of large
35 planets.

On the other hand, it is likely that some planets
are ejected from their early, turbulent solar systems,
due to close gravitational encounters with other
planets or stars. Without a star to circle, these planets

40 would move through the galaxy as our sun and others
stars do, in stable orbits around the galaxy’s center.
The discovery of 10 free-floating Jupiters supports
the ejection scenario, though it’s possible both
mechanisms are at play.

45 “Tf free-floating planets formed like stars, then we
would have expected to see only one or two of them
in our survey instead of 10,” Bennett said. “Our
results suggest that planetary systems often become
unstable, with planets being kicked out from their

50 places of birth.”

Passage 2

In a new study, Przemek Mréz of the
Astronomical Observatory of the University of
Warsaw and colleagues estimated the number of
large, rogue planets in our galaxy using a technique

55 called microlensing. When an object with a mass of a
planet passes in front of a distant, background star,
the gravity of the planet acts as a gravitational
magnifying glass. It distorts and focuses the light,
giving up the planet’s existence.

60  Mroz and colleagues looked at 2,617 microlensing
events recorded between 2010 and 2015 and
determined which were caused by a rogue planet. For
every typical star, called main sequence stars, there
are 0.25 free-floating Jupiter-mass planets, the

65 analysis suggests.

The new result sharply contrasts an estimate
published in 2011, which suggested that rogue
Jupiters are almost twice as common as main
sequence stars. About 90 percent of stars in the

70 universe are main sequence stars, so if that estimate
were accurate, there should be a lot of free-floating
Jupiters.

“That result changed our conceptual framework
of the universe just a little bit,” says astronomer

75 Michael Liu of the University of Hawaii. It
challenged long-held ideas about how planets go
rogue because the known methods wouldn’t generate
enough planets to account for all the wanderers.

The 2011 result was based on a relatively small

80 sample of microlensing events, only 474. Since then,
infrared telescope images haven’t detected as many
free-floating planets as expected. “Over the years,
serious doubts were cast over the claims of a large
population of Jupiter-mass free-floaters,” Mrdz says.

85 David Bennett, coauthor of the 2011 study, agrees
that the new census failed to find evidence for a large
population of Jupiter-mass rogue planets. He notes,

CONTINUE 4
however, that the new data do reveal four times as
many Jupiter-mass failed stars called brown dwarfs
90 than predicted in the original census. So some of the
rogues that were originally classified as planets may,
in fact, be failed stars.
Liu says the latest census is much more in line
with theories of how planets form. Most rogues
95 should be Earth-mass or a little heavier. Those lighter
planets get tossed out of their planetary systems
much easier than behemoths like Jupiter.

are more Jupiter-mass free-floating planets than
were previously assumed.

Shedding Light on the Problem

Plant-pollinating insects are essential to the
reproductive process of many flowering plants, but the
numbers of these insects are declining around the world.
Interestingly, a 2017 ecological study led by Dr. Eva Knop
suggests that artificial lighting, the modern convenience
that #© illuminates many streets, storefronts, and
athletic fields, may be contributing to the decline of these

organisms.

[1] Daytime pollinators, such as bees and butterflies,

have many well-documented threats, so Dr. Knop’s team

sought to investigate a potential threat to nocturnal
pollinators; artificial light. [2] To do so, the team

located samples of the thistle plant Cirsium oleraceum,

which is pollinated by insects, in mountain meadows that

are ordinarily dark at night. [3] Before the plants’
flowering began, some of the plants were covered with
mesh bags to outlaw visits from [2%) pollinators,

however, others were left unbagged. [4] The scientists

measured how much fruit each plant produced over the

course of its life cycle.

Whereas the unbagged plants’ fruit production

changed significantly with light exposure, the bagged
plants saw no such effect. [4] The bagged plants couldn’t

be visited by pollinators. Because of that fact, the bagged
plants self-fertilized and thus averaged only about

15 fruits per plant in dark sites but 85 fruits

The scientists also found that the decline in

nighttime pollination visits Bf% coincided with a decline

in visits from daytime pollinators. The precise cause for
this dual decline was unclear; one possibility is that the
plants were less nourishing to daytime pollinators when
no longer visited by nighttime pollinators. Whatever the
reason, artificial illumination clearly has adverse effects
on plant pollination, and the increasing B88 presents of
artificial lighting may pose a major problem for
biodiversity. “Urgent measures must be taken, to reduce
the negative consequences of the annually increasing
light emissions on the environment,” says Dr. Knop. She
is hopeful that further research will focus on ways to
reduce excessive light and revive populations of

nighttime pollinators.

Questions 12-22 are based on the following passage
and supplementary material.

Benefits of Dress Code Flexibility

In July 2016 the coffee shop chain Starbucks
instituted a new policy to relax its dress code. The
decision—allowing employees to customize their
previously uniform looks with such accessories as hats
and colorful socks— reflects workplaces across the
United States. From retail services to large corporate
offices, employers are finding that flexible dress codes can
make a company more attractive to potential

workers; boosting morale among current employees.

Given these benefits, more employers ought to embrace
the trend of relaxed dress codes.

There are a number of reasons why job applicants
might favor companies that allow for some degree of
flexibility in workplace attire. Having the option to dress
casually can mean greater physical comfort. Also, being
able to personalize otherwise identical uniforms with
unique flourishes can enhance happiness by allowing
them to retain a greater sense of personal identity in

the workplace.

Individuals’ motives may vary, but job recruiters
are finding that many potential employees do indeed
share a preference for flexible dress codes, and embracing
this preference could help companies attract a wider
range of talent. According to a 2016 study, essentially
none of those surveyed wanted to be employed by a
company with a relaxed dress code: 31 percent of
respondents reported that they would prefer a company
with a business casual dress code, and a further
27 percent reported that they would prefer a casual dress

code or no dress code at all.

D) No, because it provides loosely related
information that interrupts the discussion in the

In addition to making companies more appealing to

potential employees, dressing casually can also be a

fun way to express one’s individuality. When the

accounting firm Crowe Horwath LLP asked workers
what changes they would like to see in the BBs workplace,
and workers said that dressing casually would help them
most #413 with, “being comfortable, being engaged, and
being productive,” said chief people officer Julie Wood.
The firm started allowing workers to wear jeans and
other relatively casual attire, and the response from
employees was overwhelmingly positive. “With our
change in dress, the level of excitement and feedback
from our people has been really phenomenal,” Wood
said.

Of course, formal workplace attire is appropriate
and even required in some contexts. For example, job
interviews and client meetings often require professional
clothing. However, in certain occupations, such as
law enforcement, uniforms without personal
embellishments are still necessary. When possible,
though, companies should consider relaxing dress codes
and allow flexibility, a move that is likely to benefit both

employees and companies.

Questions 23-33 are based on the following passage.

The Filtered Net

Search engines make it easy for us to keep up with
current issues, but the information we find may not be as
objective as it appears. Many search engines collect data
from users, such as their locations and search

histories, they use what they gather to filter search

results. This invisible customization may create what
media CEO Eli Pariser has termed a “filter bubble,” a
biased worldview that is reinforced when it is
consistently confirmed rather than challenged. It is
important, especially with regard to political issues,
that search engines make their filtering practices

explicit. When search engines make them explicit,

users can be aware of potential biases when making

important decisions, especially when those decisions

are shared with friends and family members on social

media.

Psychologist Robert Epstein has shown how filtered

results, can lead to political biases. In an experiment

conducted before the 2014 general election in India,
Epstein created a fake search engine and asked 2,000
undecided voters to use it to research candidates running
for the office of prime minister. Voters were divided into
three groups, and each group was presented with results
favoring a different major-party candidate. Participants
whose searches favored a given candidate 4:3 was

12 percent more likely to report a positive view of that
candidate than were participants in other groups. While
there is no evidence that commercial search engines
intentionally skew their results in favor of certain
candidates or #4) positions, filters based on [&iij user’s

browsing history’s could produce similarly slanted

results.

This possibility is especially troubling because

most users think their searches display the full spectrum
of perspectives on an issue. The vast majority of
participants in Epstein’s experiment—99.3 percent—did
not recognize the bias in their results. Politicians
hope to counteract this: a 2012 survey from the

Pew Research Center indicated that 66 percent of
respondents believed that results obtained through a
search engine represent all available information rather
than a personalized selection.

Filtering is essential to search engines because the
sheer volume of information on the Internet makes it
impossible to display more than a small portion of all
relevant results. But in the case of political information, it
is important for users to be aware of the existence of
filters and of the factors that might bias results. If search

engines published this information —by displaying a

warning that results are selected based on user

preferences, for example—users would be better able to

read political coverage online with an appropriately
critical eye and thus base their political beliefs on a fuller

range of information.

Oglala Lakota Art Gets Rolling

A 2015 study led by First Peoples Fund, an
organization dedicated to supporting indigenous
artists revealed that roughly four out of ten
households on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in
South Dakota had home businesses centered on arts or
handicrafts. This finding reflects the deeply rooted
importance of art within the reservation’s Oglala Lakota
culture. However, the study also concluded that the
vastness of the reservation limited local artists’ ability to
collaborate with one another, find mentors, and sell their

art. Regardless of these discoveries, First Peoples

Fund worked with a group of organizations and
supporters to implement a plan for strengthening the
creative economy of the reservation. The outcome of the
organization’s combined efforts [ef have been Rolling
Rez Arts, a bus that would serve as a mobile space to
support artistic collaboration and forge critical

partnerships with local financial institutions.

Rolling Rez Arts itself was a collaborative work of art

by Oglala Lakota artists. Donald Montileaux, a 2014

inductee into the South Dakota Hall of Fame, was

selected to give the bus a distinctive appearance. He

created a lavish design for the #2 bus. This design,

intended for the sides of the bus, had vivid pictograms of
running Buffalo inspired by the narrative scenes of ledger

art. After Montileaux produced drawings of the design,

grow their art as a business. The bus also hosts a gift shop
whose manager buys works on-site to sell elsewhere
